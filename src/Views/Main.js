                                                        My passion for web development started in 6th grade when my tech teacher introduced me to basic HTML. That year, I competed against my upperclassmen in a timed code off and won!

                                                <p>
                                                        As a child of the MySpace era, I began to learn CSS to assist my friends in customizing their profiles. I was completely obsessed with the different aspects of design that I could accomplish with simple strings of code!
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                        As an adult, I put my focus into entrepreneurship, doing everything from business adminstration to graphic and web design. This eventually led me to Wix, where I got my initial introduction to JQuery and their custom language, Velo. I have been designing with Wix for over 10 years, but I was desperate to learn more.

                                                        In the Spring of 2020 I decided to enroll in Coding Dojo for a self-paced course in the MERN stack. I became enthralled in the different ways you can develop using languages like React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express. I decided to continue my education my enrolling in the part time bootcamp in Winter of 2020 to get a more one on one experience learning development.
